# 🐶🐱 Dog vs Cat Classification using Transfer Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a deep learning model that classifies images of dogs and cats using **Transfer Learning**. We use a pre-trained model to leverage existing knowledge and fine-tune it for our specific task.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Uses **Transfer Learning** for better performance.  
- Implements **TensorFlow & Keras**.  
- Handles image preprocessing & augmentation.  
- Achieves high accuracy in classifying dog vs cat images.  

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements  
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:  

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python seaborn
```

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset consists of labeled images of **dogs** and **cats**.  
- Preprocessing includes **resizing, normalization, and augmentation**.  

## 🏗️ Model Architecture  
- **Base Model**: A pre-trained CNN (e.g., **VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2**)  
- **Fine-Tuning**: Top layers are retrained on our dataset.  
- **Optimizer**: Adam  
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy  

## ▶️ How to Run the Project  
Run the Jupyter Notebook:  

```bash
jupyter notebook Project_Dog_vs_Cat_Classification_Transfer_Learning.ipynb
```

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved **97% accuracy** on the test set.  
- Model successfully classifies dogs and cats from images.
